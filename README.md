# Euler

This project provides a framework for building dynamic geometric sketches. It's meant to be a research tool for anyone interested in classical geometry and can be also used as a tool for learning / teaching programming with Swift and simple visual elements.

The project contains many simple playgrounds that describe the framework building blocks. It also contains a playground that provides a few examples of real geometric sketches (two of these sketches are for results that were discovered with this tool and submitted for publication).

This is still work in progress, and the APIs may change over time.
